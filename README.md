# JavaScript Exercises

Welcome to my JavaScript Algorithms repository. This repository contains various JavaScript exercises that I have solved and studied. Each exercise is organized into its own folder, with accompanying explanations and tests.

## Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for each exercise.
- `tests/`: Contains the test files for each exercise.
- `docs/`: Additional resources and notes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
